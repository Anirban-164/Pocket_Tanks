# Pocket_Tanks
This game was built using JavaFX by Anirban-2305164 &amp; Maung-2305181 for the course CSE-108 in Level-1 Term-2.

Here’s the summary of the features we included:
• Use the keys 'A' and 'D' to move tanks left and right within half the screen (For offline mode, use Left & Right keys for 2nd Tank)
• Use 'W' and 'S' to modify turret's angle (Up and Down keys for 2nd offline player)
• Use 'P' and 'L' to increase & decrease shot power respectively (Numpad '8' and '2' for 2nd offline player)
• Press 'F' to shoot (Numpad '5' for 2nd offline player). The cannon moves in a path of projectile
• Damage & explosion on impact
• The drone moving up and down in the center is an obstacle. Shooting at it will increase the shooter’s health. But another drone will be deployed with higher speed.

(Note: This was built for educational purpose only and hence using for commercial purpose isn't recommended.)
